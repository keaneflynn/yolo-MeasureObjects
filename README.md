# Yolo Object Detection with Distance Measurement and Bounding Box Dimensions


In this project, we will be using YOLOv4 object detection combined with an Intel Realsense D455i camera to measure the width and height of whatever object we are detecting with the YOLO CNN.

*The above image shows a blue camp mug detected based on a crudely trained yolov4-tiny neural network that is measuring the width of the mug at 129mm when I have ground truthed the width of the mug, including the handle, to be 128mm*
